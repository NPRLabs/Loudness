<b>NPR Loudness Tool</b><p>

The NPR(R) Loudness Tool (NLT) checks the levels of an audio file or files and indicates if they meet Public Radio Satellite System(R) (PRSS(R)) submission standards (http://prss.org/loudness). The NLT provides the option to adjust levels such that the resulting file is within the PRSS specifications.  Specifically, it adjusts the Integrated Loudness and the True Peaks, then saves the adjusted file.  You can install the NLT on your Mac or PC to check the levels of your audio files.<p>
The NLT is available at [http://prss.org/loudness/tool](http://prss.org/loudness/tool).  <p>
